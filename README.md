=====================================
Embedding and running Alteryx workflows and apps in custom built websites. Requires an Alteryx Server with Gallery installed.

Take a look at the [Gallery API](https://gallery.alteryx.com/api-docs/) Documentation for the API endpoints. You need to download the API files (alteryxGalleryAPI.js & oauth-signature.min.js) that can be grabbed from the API documentation.
